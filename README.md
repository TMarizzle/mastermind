Mastermind game - guess the code the computer chooses before you run out of guesses!

[!NOTE]
* Computer will generate a random code consisting of 4-5 digits
* Player will have a set number of guesses to get the code correct (~10 guesses?)
* After each guess, the game will let the player know how many numbers they have guessed correctly
* The game will say how many numbers in the guess are in the code and how many are in the correct position
* Possibly add a highlight showing which number is in the correct spot (like Wordle's puzzle)
* Maybe have a score that loses points for each guess the player uses
